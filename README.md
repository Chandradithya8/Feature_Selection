# Feature_Selection

Feature Selection is the process where you automatically or manually select those features which contribute most to your prediction variable or output in which you are interested in. Having irrelevant features in your data can decrease the accuracy of the models and make your model learn based on irrelevant features.

Three ways to perform feature selection :
 1. SelectKbest
 2. Mutual-classif-info
 3. Extra trees classifier
